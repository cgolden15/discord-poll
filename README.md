discord.js-qotd is a Node.js module that allows you to create polls or questions of the day with your discord bot. You can customize the arg separator, emoji and the embed color! This module was originally created by nicolasmf and called [discord.js-poll](https://www.npmjs.com/package/discord.js-poll). However due to lack of updates, and broken functionality I have decided to start updating it myself.

### What's next?:
* v1.6.0 Variable message content to go along with the qotd embed.
* v2.0.0 Discord.js v13 support

## Installation 

<br>

```
npm i discord.js-qotd
```

<br>

## Parameter types

<br>

```JavaScript
poll(message: Discord.Message, args: string[], separator: string, embedColor: Discord.ColorResolvable, emoji: string)
```

### Documentation 

[Discord.Message](https://discord.js.org/#/docs/main/stable/class/Message)

[Discord.ColorResolvable](https://discord.js.org/#/docs/main/stable/typedef/ColorResolvable)

## Usage example

### Code

```JavaScript
const Discord = require('discord.js');
const { poll } = require('discord.js-qotd');

module.exports = {
	name: 'qotd',
	description: 'Create a qeustion of the day embed.',
	usage: 'Title + Option 1 + Option 2 + Option 3 + etc',
	execute(client, message, args) {
		poll(message, args, '+', '#00D1CD', "ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è");
	},
};
```

### On discord

```
!qotd Is this a poll?
```

This will return an embed message with '**Is this a poll?**' as title and with üëç and üëé reactions.

<br>

```
!poll message + args1 + args2 + args3
```

This will return an embed message with '**What is your favorite food?**' as title and '*Pasta*', '*Burger*' and '*Pizza*' as fields, with corresponding reactions (üá¶ => üá®).

(If **'+'** is chosed as separator)
