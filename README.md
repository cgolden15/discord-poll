discord.js-qotd is a Node.js module that allows you to create polls or questions of the day with your discord bot. You can customize the arg separator, emoji and the embed color!

<br>

<strong>Note: Currently the ``FLAGS.GUILD_MESSAGES`` intent is required.</strong> 

This will be updated shortly by using slash commands. If you wish to contribute to this update, open a pull request.
<br>

## What's next:
* Buttons instead of reactions 
* Variable message content to go along with the qotd embed.
 
## Installation 

<br>

```
npm i discord.js-qotd
```

<br>

## Parameter types

<br>

```JavaScript
poll(message: Discord.Message, args: string[], separator: string, embedColor: Discord.ColorResolvable, emoji: string)

module.exports = {
	name: 'qotd',
	description: 'Create a qeustion of the day embed.',
	usage: 'Title + Option 1 + Option 2 + Option 3 + etc',
	execute(client, message, args) {
		poll(message, args, '+', '#00D1CD', "ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è");
	},

### On discord

<br>

```
!poll message + args1 + args2 + args3
```

This will return an embed message with '**message**' as title and '*args1*', '*args2*' and '*args3*' as fields, with corresponding reactions (üá¶ => üá®).

(If **'+'** is chosed as separator and **'ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è'** as the emoji)
